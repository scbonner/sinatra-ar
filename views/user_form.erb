<!--You will need a views subdirectory.  Within it, -->
<!--create user_form.erb, which is a form with fields for -->
<!--name and email, and a submit button, and which does a -->
<!--post to /create.  Create user_list.erb, which displays -->
<!--a list of users and their emails.  It should also have -->
<!--links for /new and /delete.  Create user_delete.erb, which -->
<!--is a form with an entry field for the name and a submit button -->
<!--labeled delete, and which uses the delete method for path â€˜/delete.  -->
<!--You will need to add this line to app.rb after the other entries, -->
<!--but before any of the code for your routes:-->

<!--require './models/user'-->
